Because a dataframe of TMDB movie details has already been created, a loop will be created to search the OMDB API by the IMDb IDs of those preretreived TMDB movies. If a movie, or movie attribute, does not exist within the OMDB API, it will be returned as \"None.\" A counter was created to track the progress of the loop since this process usually takes around 30 minutes. Every 10% interval of the loop will be printed so that the user knows how far along the loop is. The additional OMDB data is stored in the same method as the TMDB data - within dictionaries and inside of one common list. After the loop is complete, the additional data list will be converted to a Pandas dataframe and the TMDB and OMDB dataframes will be merged together by index. Lastly, the dataframe is saved as a csv file and ready for cleaning."
